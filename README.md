# devops-production-lab
Production-grade DevOps implementations covering Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, and automation, structured as real-world systems

This repository is a hands-on DevOps production lab where I design, build, and document real-world infrastructure and delivery systems using industry-standard tools.

Instead of isolated examples, this repo focuses on end-to-end, production-grade setups , covering infrastructure provisioning, networking, compute, containerization, orchestration, CI/CD, and automation. 
Each tool is organized into its own section with clear structure, reusable code, and detailed explanations of design decisions.
